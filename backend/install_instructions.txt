To resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`, please follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated. If not, navigate to the backend directory and activate it:
    ```bash
    cd D:\coding\hackathon\ColdDraft\backend
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  Install the new dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Once the installation is complete, you can try to run the server again using the instructions I provided earlier.
